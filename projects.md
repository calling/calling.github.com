	<dt>Artificial Intelligence: Search in Pacman</dt>
	<dd>In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.</dd>
	<dt>Artificial Intelligence: Multi-Agent Pacman</dt>
	<dd>In this project, you will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, you will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try your hand at evaluation function design.</dd>
	<dt>Artificial Intelligence: Reinforcement Learning</dt>
	<dd>In this project, you will implement value iteration and Q-learning. You will test your agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.</dd>
	<dt>Artificial Intelligence: Ghostbuster</dt>
	<dd>In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. You'll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.</dd>
	<dt>Artificial Intelligence: Classification</dt>
	<dd>In this project, you will design three classifiers: a naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron classifier and a large-margin (MIRA) classifier. You will test your classifiers on two image data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face images in which edges have already been detected. Even with simple features, your classifiers will be able to do quite well on these tasks when given enough training data.</dd>
