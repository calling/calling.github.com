* [Operating Systems: Threading](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa12/Nachos/phase1.html)
* [Operating Systems: Multiprogramming](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa12/Nachos/phase2.html)
* [Operating Systems: Single Server Key-Value Store](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa12/phase3.html)
* [Operating Systems: Distributed Key-Value Store](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/\~cs162/fa12/phase4.html)

* Artificial Intelligence: Classification. Wrote three classifiers: a naive Bayes classifier, a perceptron classifier and a large-margin (MIRA) classifier. Tested classifiers on two image data sets: a set of scanned handwritten digit images and a set of face images in which edges have already been detected.
