## Overview

This is an opinionated onboarding curriculum for new managers. Itâ€™s designed for managers of new managers who are guiding them through the basics.

- Part 1 covers core, day-to-day management skills.
- Part 2 outlines recurring responsibilities.
- Part 3 offers ad hoc learning materials.

## Execution

Conduct weekly 30 minute 1:1s with your new managerial report. Each 1:1 should reserve time (~10 minutes) to discuss the New Manager Curriculum. Review what the report has learned since the prior week, and assign learning materials for the report to review on their own for next week. The manager should be fluent with the material prior. Cover day-to-day competencies first, then periodic responsibilities as they become relevant. Inject and add ad hoc materials as they become relevant.
