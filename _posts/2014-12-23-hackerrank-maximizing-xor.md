title: Hacker Rank — Maximizing XOR
published: false

Problem: <https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximizing-xor>
My solution:

{% highlight javascript %}
function maxXor(l, r) {
var l = parseInt(l, 10), r = parseInt(r, 10);
var max = 0
for (var i = l; i <= r; i++) {
for (var j = l; j <= r ; j++) {
if (i <= j) {
var xor = i ^ j;
if (xor > max) {
max = xor;
}
}
}
}
return max;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The solution ended up being more condensed than I had hoped. My original solution resembled:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
function createPairs(l, r) {
var result = [];
for (var i = l; i <= r; i++) {
for (var j = l; j <= r ; j++) {
if (i <= j) {
result.push([i, j]);
}
}
}
return result;
}

function maxXor(l, r) {
var l = parseInt(l, 10), r = parseInt(r, 10);
var pairs = createPairs(l, r)
var xors = pairs.map(function(pair) {
return pair[0] ^ pair[1];
});
return Math.max.apply(Math, xors);
}
{% endhighlight %}

I'll walk through my original solution first. `maxXor` takes two Strings of Numbers that ranged from \\(1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^{3}\\). The function must return the maximal values of A xor B given, \\(L ≤ A ≤ B ≤ R\\). First, we need the Numbers out of the Strings (line 14). Next, delegate to creating all possible pairs of A and B given the constraints of the problem. The function `createPairs` runs a two dimensional loop that returns an Array of Arrays (the inner Array representing a 'pair'). Next, xor all of the pairs, obtaining a new Array of Numbers. Next, courtesy of John Resig's [advice](http://ejohn.org/blog/fast-javascript-maxmin/) find the max Number of the Array.

Unfortunately, `Max.apply` yields a `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` for `l=1, r=1000`. Surprisingly, `Function.prototype.apply` can [only receive an array of limited length](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20940386/1950772) and since the result of `createPairs(1, 1000)` is quite large, yet well within the problem constraints, we'll need to re-think finding the max approach. We could either find a better way to determine the max value of an Array of values, or we could keep a running value of the max. A quick glance over maxXor told me that runtime could be trivially optimized from it's current \\(O(3nm)\\) to a semi-palatable \\(O(nm)\\) if we did maintained everything in the loops. Since this was still pretty simple, I went with it. If this were production code, and optimization was not yet a concern, I'd consider organizing the code how I'd originally done for readability.
